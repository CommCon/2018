    his time on Parrots and Lego dogs with &#124;pipe&#124;\r\n\r\nHis business card says he's
    a 'Protocol Droid'. He has spoken at various conferences, and one Youtube talk
    on webRTC has 65k views. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7NsiFXcc5A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7NsiFXcc5A)) \r\n\r\nTim
    is currently creating a secure, direct authenticated data transport layer between
    connected devices and their owners.\r\nWhich seems to involve directly controlling
    a Lego dog from a web browser.\r\nTim alternates between running startups and
    consulting for larger companies. He's currently in a startup phase.\r\nPast projects
    have included training simulation for oil platforms, time management of a space
    telescope and running a mobile phone network at the Burning Man festival."

  title: Realtime Thing Fun
  abstract: \"It's Fun to have Fun, but you have to know how\" said the Cat in the Hat before he let out Thing One and Thing Two.
    This workshop will introduce you to the fun you can have with devices at the crossover between Internet of Things and realtime communications whilst keeping them in a secure box.
  description: "Many of the skills and tools we use in realtime communications are
    very relevant for today's IoT devices.\r\nYou'll use your skills with WebRTC,
    IVR, NAT traversal etc to build a device.\r\n(A video doorbell perhaps, or a remotely
    controllable PodCast device, or a webcam on wheels)\r\nWe will provide a selection
    of screens, lights, sensors, actuators, cameras, microphones etc which can be
    plugged into a Raspberry Pi.\r\nWe will provide software and APIs to let you get
    your selected hardware obeying your every whim! You'll use your smartphones as
    remote\r\ncontrols for these devices.\r\nMentors will be on hand to help you get
    everything working.\r\n\r\nThere will be a prize for the best (As selected by
    Dan) working assembly.\r\n\r\nYou, or your co-experimentor will need some javascript
    skills to get the best out of the hardware provided."
  notes: Ideally we'd like to bring some IoT narrowband cards to attach to the Pi's
    but I don't know if we can manage that - if not wifi will have to do.

  title: Emergence of WebRTC in new verticals
  abstract: This talk showcases the growth and the emergence of WebRTC in different
    verticals.
  description: WebRTC is the dominant technology for delivering real-time communications,
    be it communication apps for team-communication, gaming, health-care, language-learning,
    online-tutoring, or banking and insurance. It is making in-roads in to call-centres
    where the cloudification is making it easier to run click-to-call centres. Beyond
    the audio and video, the data-channels are reigniting the spark for a distributed
    web, i.e, bittorrent type of data delivery. This talk is going to go beyond these
    areas and talk about the emergence and use of WebRTC in connected cars, conversational
    devices, IoT, and video surveillance verticals.

    new member to party, Meedoze, which contains advanced features (VP9 SVC support,
    Double-encryption a.k.a. PERC Lite). \nWe will provide an overview of the state
    of the art so you can choose which is the options that fits you best."
  description: "Based on several years of Work on Meedoze technology, recent work
    as CoSMo's Tech Lead Media Server for Symphony (Jitsi-based) and Evasyst (janus-based),
    and reverse engineering of chrome for VP9 SVC support, webrtc media server expert
    Sergio Murillo will deliver a great talk about the technical aspects of open-source
    webrtc MCU / SFUs in general, how they compare, the latest advances, and the features
    to look for when choosing one.\r\n\r\nAlso, he will introduce Meedoze server technology
    portfolio which has been open sourced early 2018, and contains advanced features
    (VP9 SVC support, Double-encryption a.k.a. PERC Lite), showing a live example
    about how to use it to create a simple but powerful tool for libwertc developers.\r\n"
  notes: "I have changed the abstract for the talk a bit, as I would prefer not to
    talk about products in which I don't have hands on expertise and which I am competing
    with (with seems un-ethical to me).\r\n\r\nI will provide an overview on the technical
    trends on SFUs nowdays (based on Gustavo's efforts http://www.rtcbits.com/2017/06/different-webrtc-flavours-from.html)
    and then move to a more deep dive on the projects I have commited patches to (so
    they can't say it is unfair competence): jitsi, janus and medooze and use them
    as the different kinds of architecture you may choose from:\r\n\r\n- jitsi ->
    turn key\r\n- janus -> customize your own server\r\n- medooze -> get your hands
    dirty and build everything on top\r\n\r\nThen, I will provide a live example on
    how Medooze media server was used to create a  tool based on llibwebrtc peerconnection_server
    to provide an echo server which can be used when testing libwertc modifications/hacks

  title: 'The 90''s Called: It Wants Your IVR Back'
  abstract: |-
    Remember the days when the sole purpose of an IVR was to "sort" callers into various streams? It was all about simply creating divisions of callers with different topics for call center agents who "specialize" in their issue.
    That's *so* 90's.
    IVR has progressed far past that -- and so should you.
  description: "The idea that the purpose of an IVR is just to \"sort\" callers to
    be better handled by specific agents is an old, tired, outdated one.\r\nNothing
    says \"90'\" better than a phone system which drones on: \"For this, press that.....for
    this other thing, press that...\" It lacks imagination, it's predictable, and
    it's not using the IVR to its best ability. With a skillfully crafted phone tree,
    you can carry your brand message to your callers. You can build relationships,
    you can reinforce customer choice, and you can actually create a strong identity
    through your IVR.\r\nFrom her unique vantage point as a professional telephone
    voice, Allison Smith -- heard on IVRs worldwide for enterprise phone systems,
    IVRs for Fortune 500 companies, and in both the proprietary and Open Source world
    -- will shed some insight on where IVRs *were* -- and where they are headed. It's
    a more vibrant, personality-filled IVR than was ever conceived of in the 90's
    -- and it's about time."
  notes: 'I record IVR day and day out. It''s my wheelhouse, my specialty, and more
    core competency. Many people can speak at length about mapping out IVR schematics
    and the technical aspects of programming IVR; I get into the psychology of IVR:
    what makes it dreaded by most callers, and how it can be changed with some mindful
    construction and a belief that its capable of doing a great many more things than
    traditionally thought.'

    ago we stared with automation with our java backed systems. A Little later we
    have made the first steps in order to automate VoIP Systems so we can handle the
    large system with less effort and more precision. During the process I have worked
    on different ways to use ansible. Performing some little steps in addition to
    the existing process up to an entire new deployment process from scratch I have

    VoIP is not just any service. There special needs and limitations we have to face
    during a deployment. I'll give samples and ways how to use ansible in order to
    deploy asterisk, kamailo or yate.
  description: "We use ansible in our company to deploy every kind of service including
    voip systems. We have made lots of iterations and we hope everybody can make use
    of our experience. automation makes systems uniform and the deployment much faster
    while less complex for developers and administrator.\r\nan automatic way of deployment
    can be used for one system only as well as a high scaled infrastructure with several
    hundreds of systems. No matter if the systems are on bare metal or some kind of
    container ansible can be used.\r\n\r\nI gave a talk at astricon very similar to
    what i am planning here. During this talk I will concentrate more on the ansible
    specifics to be used for voip services. "
  notes: "During my work at sipgate we have made a lot improvements to spare us a
    lot of time using automation such as ansible. I have written lots of ansible scripts
    myself so i have made lots of experience in using ansible as a developer as well

  title: Scaling VoIP into the Container Era
  abstract: |-
    It's time to bring devops to VoIP.  While less straight-forward than the average
    webapp deployment, we have much to gain from modern tooling.  Kubernetes, in
    particular, is an important part of any scalable VoIP deployment.
  description: "None of the usual VoIP components lends itself well to operating in
    a containerized environment.  The configuration is tedious and complicated.  IP
    addresses are critical.  NAT is brutal.  But that doesn't mean all hope is lost.\r\n\r\nWith
    a distillation of configuration dynamics, a bit of good architecture, and a generous
    amount of glue, we can establish a scalable, redundant, and reliable VoIP system
    leveraging all that is good from Kubernetes and modern container-based architecture.\r\n"
  notes: Kubernetes is a perennially popular topic, and while this talk will be similar
    to the one I did at Astricon the year before last, the method and implementations
    are now more refined and more flexible.  Additionally, we integrate some of the
    new features in Kubernetes to make deployments simpler.

    critical for open source developers.  I'll also give examples from my own experiences
    in the field of open source real-time communication platforms.
  description: "When I was in my early twenties, my parents gave me a copy of Steven
    Covey's book entitled *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*.  I promptly thought
    \"I don't need a self-help book\" and put it on my shelf.  Twenty years later,
    I picked it up, started to read it, and was shocked at how many of the principles
    taught in that book line up with Open Source software and community development.\r\n\r\nIn
    this talk, I'll put an open source twist on those seven habits, and share experiences
    that I've had over my career as an open source developer, enthusiast, and community
    evangelist.  "

  title: Realtime Machine Learning
  abstract: 'Machine learning itself is decidedly not real time. Why, it can take
    days for multi-GPU machines to assemble a working model! The results for RTC,
    however, could be revolutionary: video/audio optimization, advanced NLU, speaker
    synthesis, realtime session transmission tuning... and crime!'
  description: "Machine learning is an exploding field - with the arrival of cloud
    GPU instances and libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch, models can be trained
    in ways that were never practical before. For us working in RTC, we can now leverage
    those tools to both solve issues with realtime communications and create new ones.
    Who's interested in crime?\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll discuss the future of ML
    with RTC. We've recently seen rapid advances in ASR, TTS, and machine translation.
    Incorporating these directly into our platforms is now a simple API call away.
    Next up is optimization of audio and video using models like Google's RAISR, allowing
    us to realtime upscale the image stream on the client side with no artifacting.
    Similarly we can do advanced noise suppression using tools like Mozilla's RRNoise
    or, even more exciting, only send a subset of audio and recreate speech on the
    far side using a model of the speakers voice.\r\n\r\nMachine learning works best
    when there is voluminous amounts of well-structured data -- something that we
    generate each call in spades! We can also use machine learning to analyze data
    and watch metrics during a session to re-route or optimize bitstreams accordingly.
    After the call, we can take a look at the statistics to improve future performance.\r\n\r\nBut
    what if you weren't the ethical, upstanding citizen you are today? These tools
    can also be used for nefarious purposes. Imagine receiving a call from someone
    you loved saying there were in the hospital, so you quickly leave your house unlocked.
    And are we OK putting voice over actors out of work? We'll talk through some of
    the societal repercussions of these advances."
  notes: 'No real technical requirements other than an interest in RTC and machine
    learning! This talk will expand on the talks I''ve given previously and it''ll
    incorporate both practical and theoretical new advances in the field. We''ll also
    dive into a few of the ethical dilemmas behind these technologies so everything
    has something to discuss over lunch.  '

    "Our hyper cool video conference app requires Chrome browser"

    Tired of reading that? Are you planning to build your own multi-party WebRTC app but can't even figure out how to deal with the different API and feature set of each browser?

    I feel your pain. That's why I started the mediasoup project.
  description: "Given the state of the art of WebRTC and how browsers differ on their
    API implementations, building nowadays a cross-device compatible WebRTC multi-party
    app becomes so tedious.\r\n\r\n[mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org) to the rescue.
    By providing a powerful, low level, unopinionated and unified client-side SDK,
    mediasoup makes it easy to build WebRTC multi-party applications that run on all
    modern browsers (yes, also in Safari and Microsoft Edge).\r\n\r\n* mediasoup is
    all about media (audio and video).\r\n* It doesn't touch your DOM.\r\n* No assumptions
    regarding the signaling, usage, business or purpose of your app.\r\n* mediasoup
    just assumes that you like JavaScript :)\r\n\r\nThis talk is an introduction to
    how to integrate the mediasoup components into your application (and not the other
    way around) because **your app is up to you.**"

  title: 'Scaling server-side WebRTC applications: the Janus challenge'
  abstract: Janus is a general purpose WebRTC server, so scaling is often a tricky
    business that can't prescind from the context. The talk will describe how we worked
    on separation of responsibilities, brokering of resources and media forwarding
    for different use cases, and our efforts on some kind of a "PaaS".
  description: "While P2P media in a browser is one of the best things WebRTC provided
    to web developers and media enthusiasts, WebRTC servers are often needed to make
    WebRTC applications actually \"scale\", especially with respect to the computing
    and networking load clients may be subject to otherwise. That said, WebRTC servers
    may need scaling considerations of their own, typically whenever the number of
    users to serve grows beyond the capabilities of a single instance. This is true
    for Janus as well, an open source WebRTC server implemented by Meetecho.\r\n\r\nFor
    Janus, though, scaling is an even trickier business. In fact, its general purpose
    nature means there are different plugins with completely different requirements
    and media management, which means there is no one-size-fits-all mechanism for
    scaling Janus-based applications: while some plugins handle each user and their
    media streams independently of each other, making it easier to just distribute
    the load on different servers, some don't or can't, e.g., due to relationships
    that may exist among the media they involve. As such, in order to effectively
    scale, one cannot prescind from the context of the application or use case, in
    order to evaluate the best possible strategy depending on which plugin is in use,
    or how the plugin is used.\r\n\r\nThe talk will go through some of our efforts
    in that direction, and more specifically will describe how we identified some
    common properties in the different use cases we had to address. Different strategies
    will be presented, ranging from a simple deployment of multiple instances, to
    context-aware separation of responsibilities and brokering of the media resources.
    The presentation will finally also describe our steps and efforts in defining
    an ad-hoc framework for making this as transparent as possible to developers and
    users, in order to come up with what may be seen as a \"PaaS\", or \"Janus-as-a-service\"
    if you like."
  notes: "How to scale Janus is a question we're asked a lot, and, as explained in
    the description, a tough one to answer. In our consulting activities we often
    had to address this issue one way or another, whether the use case was conferencing,
    broadcasting, gatewaying or some form of media processing, which is why we collected
    some useful practices for us to re-use here and there. This is what lead us to
    also start working on a pseudo-PaaS(*) approach for Janus, with the help of some
    students from the University of Napoli: we plan to expand our efforts in that
    direction soon, and expect to have exciting stuff available before the event!\r\n\r\n(*)
    the \"pseudo\" tag comes from the fact that we don't plan to attack the WebRTC
    PaaS market, or compete with the existing providers there: this is really just
    an effort to implement automatic scalability for Janus for ourselves and others,
    and in a way that can be installed on premise as well, rather than making it available
    on a cloud provider managed by us."

    candidate of the WebRTC specifications. More specifically, we touch on WebRTC
    testing at different levels: W3C JS API compliance, stand-alone web application\r\ntesting,
    WebRTC security testing, P2P network and ICE testing, synchronous and asymmetric
    testing and eventually show the emergence of a need for full global interoperability
    testing. We will show at each level how WebRTC has been pushing boundaries of
    existing test suites, and triggering new developments both for the standards,
    and for the industry.\r\n\r\nFinally We will present KITE, an open source, generic,
    reusable and easy to maintain automated testing environment for testing WebRTC
    P2P interoperability across all types of WebRTC-compliant clients.\r\n"

  bio: "With over 40 years experience with Telecommunications Systems, James has been
    described as a ‘Walking Wikipedia for Communications Systems’.  As an energetic
    exponent of Open Source software he has been intimately involved with projects
    like Asterisk, Kamailio, and FreeSWITCH since their inception.  For the 10 year
    period between 2006 and 2016 he was responsible for much of the really innovative
    components of Truphone as it evolved from the World’s first mobile VoIP operator
    into a fully fledged International Mobile Network Operator with a huge high end
    user community.  Having demonstrated the art of building Open Source based Mobile
    Network infrastructure at the Telecoms Application Developers events (TAD Summit)
    and being selected by the Small Cell Forum as Global Operator Champion for Multi
    Operator Neutral Host (MONeH) Small Cells, he left Truphone in November 2016 to
    bootstrap a new company with the specific aim of building all of the components
    required to enable privately owned publicly accessible mobile networks, starting
    with a solution to solve the problem of Rural Not-Spots.\r\n\r\nJames has spent
    the past 5 years co-hosting the weekly VUC Podcast [ VUC.me ]."

  title: How to deploy your own 4G mobile system
  abstract: Two years ago it was almost impossible to deploy a mobile network without
    being a big MNO and spending huge amounts of cash. Today things have changed -
    and James will demonstrate how it is possible to set up your own publicly accessible
    mobile network without breaking the bank - or the law!
  description: "This workshop will run through all of the components required to assemble
    a fully functional 4G (LTE-A) Multi Operator Neutral Network (MONeH).  Hardware
    can be either Open Source or Commercial-Off-the-Shelf based, coupled with software
    and services assembled from easily accessible sources.  Add to this exciting mixture
    James’ ‘Magic Ingredients’, including the super secret MONeH SIM (multi-IMSI/mult-crypto
    capable) and licenced interconnections with the Public Mobile Networks via a cloud
    based mobile network core.\r\n\r\nWe will also debunk the mystery behind getting
    usable mobile spectrum to run your own network on - without having to invest billions
    of dollars in National Spectrum Auctions!"
  notes: "Should this talk be accepted we will aim to deploy a live 4G system within
    the venue and will issue each registered attendee with a Commcon branded Multi-IMSI/multi-crypto
    SIM card for use(/abuse) during the conference.  SIMs will be capable of operation
    both on public and private networks.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will need to be
    given as close to the beginning of the event as possible, as it will explain and
    demonstrate the functionality of the event system/SIMs - which then be used by
    internal communications and application development later on."

  bio: "I've been \"doing\" VoIP since 2000, when I founded a SIP application server
    company (Pactolus Communication Software) that made and sold a commercial software-based
    application server/app suite to carriers and communication service providers worldwide.
    \ With customers ranging from Webex to Deutsche Telekom and many successful deployments
    under my belt, I learned quite a bit but increasingly saw both the challenges
    and opportunities created by the disruption that was the open source movement.
    \ \r\n\r\nWhile on an extended \"adventure sabbatical\" a few years ago, mostly
    spent in beautiful Pembrokeshire Wales,  I decided to create drachtio, an open
    source framework that at once combined my desires to work in the open source movement
    \ and to find a useful vessel in which to invest the knowledge that I had gained
    over the years in building and deploying VoIP networks and applications that had
    to be held to the highest standards of performance and reliability.\r\n\r\nI love
    writing software both for the web and VoIP and am enjoying being a part of working
    to see these two worlds come together.  I'm also an avid rugby fan, and have enjoyed
    playing for teams ranging from the US national team in my heyday to the 5th division
    St Davids Saints more recently.  While at the conference, I would love to talk
    to anyone about Wales chances in the next world cup!\r\n"

  title: drachtio - The open-source VoIP framework for full-stack WebRTC developers
  abstract: "How come \"full-stack webRTC developer\" isn't a thing?  \n\ndrachtio
    is the open-source framework that means to change all that: enabling web developers
    to build their own high-performance back-end VoIP networks and applications using
    tools and programming patterns that they are already familiar with."
  description: "# drachtio - The open-source VoIP framework for full-stack webRTC
    developers\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nWebRTC and VoIP.  The odd couple of modern communications.
    \ WebRTC gives web developers exciting new abilities to create innovative communication
    and collaboration applications, but  only to the extent that someone has built
    out a reliable and performant back-end VoIP network.  And until now, that has
    required specialized skills, knowledge and often domain-specific programming languages
    that a web developer can't hope to acquire and maintain as a side effort to his
    or her day job.  The Drachtio open source project aims to change that -- to introduce
    the concept of a \"full-stack webRTC developer\" -- by providing a pure Javascript
    node-js based framework that allows web developers to build their own back-end
    networks and applications using tools and programming patterns that they are already
    familiar with.\r\n\r\nDrachtio is an open source project that comprises a high-performance,
    programmable SIP server along with a nodejs-based application framework that leverages
    common middleware patterns that a modern web developer will already know and love.
    \ It is the new kid on the block, but has been already deployed in multiple carrier
    and service provider networks around the world where it is used to deliver a wide
    range of VoIP applications and is carrying hundreds of millions of minutes per
    month.  This talk will cover the drachtio architecture and programming model,
    position it relative to other VoIP projects such as Kamailio, Freeswitch and the
    rest of the gang, will describe some of the use case deployments, and provide
    the audience with an easy path to further explore and deploy VoIP services and
    back-end networks using it.\r\n\r\n## Why drachtio\r\nToday, more so than at any
    time in the past, we have the ability to build out a fairly rich set of VoIP communications
    networks and servers to deliver services to our subscribers and communities.  Possible,
    but not easy - at least not \"full-stack web development easy\".  \r\n\r\nUsing
    products such as Kamailio, Freeswitch, and Asterisk it is possible to deploy VoIP
    networks at low cost and at scale.  Kamailio, for instance, is a powerful SIP
    proxy and edge element, but deployments require mastering its rather cryptic configuration
    language.  Freeswitch and Asterisk provide flexible media-processing capabilities,
    but each comes with a significant learning curve investment as well in terms of
    extensive configuration as well as detailed SIP language knowledge.  Each of these
    products, however, have a place in the constellation of open source VoIP elements,
    as does drachtio.  Drachtio sits in between Kamailio and Freeswitch, if you will,
    in providing a \"home\" for most of the VoIP application code a developer will
    write while leveraging those elements as needed.  For a modern web developer familiar
    with middleware patterns such as those exposed by express, connect, hapi, or koa,
    drachtio will fit comfortably to hand. The only difference is that rather than
    building an HTTP-based services, drachtio enables building SIP-based servers (and
    clients!  and registrars! and presence servers! etc).\r\n\r\n## Use Cases\r\nWe
    will discuss and review how drachtio is being used today in communication service
    provider networks.  Use case descriptions will include:\r\n- intelligent call
    steering (e.g., time of day, geographic, network utilization)\r\n- WebRTC gateway\r\n-
    call / media recording\r\n- class 5 type services \r\n- VoIP emergency services\r\n-
    others\r\n\r\n# Architecture\r\nWe will review the architecture in some detail,
    giving the audience a sense of the programming model and how drachtio aims to
    provide carrier-class reliability and scalability features \r\n\r\n# Getting started
    / resources\r\nFor those interested in jumping right in after the talk, we will
    review how to get quickly up and running with sample applications and deployments,
    and provide pointers to where to go to get more help."

  title: ARI workshop with php-ari
  abstract: PHP is most probably the darling language of Asterisk platform developers
    - it's been around for years, it's stable - and information is all over. But,
    AGI is limited - time to spread your wings with PHP and ARI.
  description: "The world is changing and the need for a new breed of Asterisk voice
    applications is here. Asynchronous applications are not enough any more, we need
    more power and more control over our calls and media streams. This session will
    introduce you the Asterisk REST interface, a new methodology of developing next
    generation Asterisk applications, specifically with the PHP-ARI library. \r\n\r\nPHP-ARI
    was created as bridge for classic PHP developers, looking to get started with
    Asterisk ARI, without the need to learn a new development language or development
    paradigm. \r\n\r\nWhat should you know in order to participate in this workshop:\r\n1.
    A basic understanding of the Asterisk Open Source PBX platform\r\n2. A basic understanding
    of PHP \r\n3. Some familiarity with the legacy PHP-AGI library\r\n\r\nWhat will
    we do during the workshop? that is very much up-to-you. The workshop is will be
    an open ended workshop, where the concepts and paradigms will be presented with
    some basic exercises. Following the basic workshop we will continue to the first
    ever ARI Mob-Programming/Mini-Hackathon session, where the workshop participants
    will split into small work-groups (up to 4 participants in each group) - and we
    will all code the same application requirement. Following the code session, all
    will present their application - to the \"grilling\" of the audience. \r\n\r\n###
    Best implementation will win a special [cloudonix.io](http://cloudonix.io/) sponsored
    award - for the entire team."
  notes: "Some technical requirements:\r\n\r\n1. Bring your own laptop - we will not
    be providing these for participants\r\n2. If you are anything like me and require
    a keyboard to code with - bring it\r\n\r\nI suggest you do some lite reading about
    [php-ari](http://www.phpari.org/) before hand - this is purely optional.\r\n\r\nDuring
    the session we will be doing additional mini-hackathon, which will be to provide
    a new version of PHP-ARI based upon the ReactPHP framework. If you would like
    to participate in that, send me an email to *commcon2018 at cloudonix.io*"
